                  <h1>Lily Lyons' Junior Portfolio</h1>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Intro</h3>
                  <p>My name is Lily Lyons, and I am a junior at Northview High School. I came to this
                    Career Tech program because I love video games and want to make them when I grow up.
                    I already know four programming languages: Scratch, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Professional Information</h3>
                  <p>I currently do Computer Programming Career Tech at Northview High School, where my
                    teacher is Mrs. Tammi Ramsey. Before my time at Northview, I did Information Technology
                    at Arbor Hills Junior High School for three years and programmed in Scratch during my 
                    free time. When I graduate from Northview, I want to go to the University of Michigan to
                    major in Game Development and Design.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Personal Life</h3>
                  <p>I live with my parents and twin brother, Luke. I am on Northview's Varsity Quiz Bowl team
                    as Assistant Captain and will become captain next year after the current captain, Alex Passero,
                    graduates. Outside of school, I like to knit, crochet, and play video games.
